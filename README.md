# Modal Button Interaction Project

This is a simple single-page project demonstrating how to use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create interactive **modal popups**. The goal of the project was to introduce and implement JavaScript `onclick` functionality for user interactions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- A **single webpage** featuring **three buttons**.
- Each button triggers a **unique modal popup** when clicked.
- The modal contains:
  - A **heading**
  - A **paragraph**
  - An **image** related to the button clicked.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring the content
- **CSS** – for styling the page and modals
- **JavaScript** – for handling button click events and modal display logic

## 💡 Features

- Interactive modal windows that appear based on user action
- Dynamic content changes depending on the button clicked
- Clean and responsive layout with basic styling

## 📂 Project Structure

├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── style.css          # CSS styling
└── script.js          # JavaScript logic for modal functionality
```

## 📋 How It Works

1. The user clicks one of the three buttons.
2. A modal popup appears, customized with:
   - A relevant heading
   - A descriptive paragraph
   - An image specific to the button clicked
3. The user can close the modal by clicking outside the modal or on a close button (if implemented).

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure a basic interactive webpage
- How to use JavaScript `onclick` events to manipulate the DOM
- How to show/hide elements dynamically
- Introduction to working with modals in web development

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Add animations to modal open/close
- Improve accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation)
- Make the modal reusable with dynamic content injection
